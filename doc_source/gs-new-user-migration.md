# Get started migrating<a name="gs-new-user-migration"></a>

Directly migrating servers is efficient because your servers are migrating while you simultaneously group them into applications\.

Use this section to guide you through the initial console pages that AWS Migration Hub presents to the first\-time user to view, compare, and connect the migration tools to Migration Hub\.

Remember that if you haven't selected a Migration Hub home region, the first time you view the console, you'll be required to select one\.

It is important to understand that connecting a migration tool to Migration Hub is how you authorize that tool to communicate migration status to Migration Hub in your home region\. Without this authorization, Migration Hub will not track your migration\. 

**To start migrating without performing discovery**

1. Choose **Get started migrating** on the AWS Migration Hub page, as described in [Two ways to get started](getting-started.md#gs-the-two-ways)\.

1. In the **Get started migrating** dialog box, choose **Connect migration tools**\.
