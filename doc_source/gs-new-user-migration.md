# Migrate Without Performing Discovery<a name="gs-new-user-migration"></a>

Directly migrating servers is efficient because your servers are already migrating while you simultaneously group them into applications\.

Use this section to guide you through the initial console screens that Migration Hub presents to the first\-time user to view, compare, and connect AWS migration tools to Migration Hub\. It is important to understand that connecting an AWS migration tool to Migration Hub is how you authorize that tool to communicate migration status to Migration Hub\. Without this authorization, Migration Hub will not track your migration\. *If you want to learn more about integrated migration tools, including AWS and partner tools, go to the **Migration Tools** page in Migration Hub \(Migrate \-> Tools\) and follow the link to the documentation or to AWS Marketplce*\.

Once you get past the new user screens, this section will reference the [AWS Migration Hub Walkthroughs](walkthroughs.md) for remaining steps\.

1. If you chose **Get started migrating** in the new user screen, the **Migrate Without Performing Discovery** screen is displayed\. Choose **Connect migration tools**\.
