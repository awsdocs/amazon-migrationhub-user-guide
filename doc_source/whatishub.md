# What Is AWS Migration Hub?<a name="whatishub"></a>

AWS Migration Hub provides a single place to discover your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each application migration\. The AWS Migration Hub provides visibility into your application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking\. You can see the status of the servers and databases that make up each of the applications you are migrating regardless of which migration tool you are using\.

AWS Migration Hub gives you the choice to start migrating right away and group servers while migration is underway, or to first discover servers and then group them into applications\. Either way, you can migrate each server in an application and track progress from each tool in the AWS Migration Hub\. It supports migration status updates from AWS Database Migration Service, AWS Server Migration Service, [ATADATA ATAmotion](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/partners/), [CloudEndure Live Migration](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/partners/), and [RiverMeadow Migration SaaS](https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/partners/)\.

For more information, open the AWS Migration Hub console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/migrationhub/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/), and in the navigation pane under **Migrate**, choose **Tools**\. *Note that you must first have an AWS account and credentials to access the Migration Hub console \- see* [Setting Up](setting-up.md)\.
