# Perform Discovery and Then Migrate<a name="gs-new-user-discovery"></a>

Discovering your servers first is an optional starting point for migrations by gathering detailed server information and then grouping the discovered servers into applications to be migrated and tracked\.

Use this section to guide you through the initial console screens that Migration Hub presents to the first\-time user to view, compare, and download AWS discovery tools\. *If you are not sure about the differences between the two AWS discovery tools, Discovery Connectors and Discovery Agents, see the [AWS discovery tools comparison chart](discovery-wt-discover.md#discovery-wt-aws-disco-tools)*\.

Once you get past the new user screens, this section will reference the [AWS Migration Hub Walkthroughs](walkthroughs.md) for remaining steps\.

1. If you chose **Get started with discovery** in the new user screen, the **Perform Discovery and Then Migrate** screen is displayed\. Choose **View AWS discovery tools**\.
